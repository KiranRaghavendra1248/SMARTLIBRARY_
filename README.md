# DSCWOW_SMARTLIBRARY
Library system automation using Face Recognition and Optical Character Recogntion

# OBJECTIVE
Automation of  libraries in schools and colleges , for effective storage of records of students who frequent the libraries to borrow books.
Our main aim is to remove the current drawbacks i.e the requirement of a physical presence in the library who takes down records of people borrowing books.
We completely automate the process of borrowing a book so the person who borrows the book has zero or minimal contact with other people.
